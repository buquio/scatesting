///////////////Pluggin Frontend Directory setup
Good evening @everyone
So let's walk through the frontend setup
Here's the link 
https://github.com/zurichat/zc_plugin_channels
If you run it, you'll see 3 branches
- main
- dev
- charles.duruaku-dev (this is my branch)

Download the code base
Open frontend/src
The redux folder is there all the redux stuff happens
components is where all the component stuff sits
  - component/home contains all the components for the home screen (for example)
  - component/shared contains all shared components
  - src/utils you'll find api.js which holds all the endpoints we're hitting, utils.js is where all our utility stuff sit
  - Don't worry about theme.js
  - src/routes is where all the routes sit
  - Please observe package.json file well, I installed a few utils
  - moment - for date formatting
  - axios - for handling api requests
  - lodash - utility for performing heavy and light operations easily
  - uuid - for random ID
  - node-sass and sass - enables you to use .scss in the project
  - react-icons - Library for icons
